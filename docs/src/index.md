# SOM.jl - Kohonen's self-organising maps for Julia

The package provides training and visualisation functions
for Kohonen's self-organising maps for Julia.
Training functions are implemented in pure Julia, without calling
external libraries.    
Visualisation is implemented by using Python's Matplotlib.


## Self-organising maps

Self-organising maps (also referred to as SOMs or *Kohonen* maps) are
artificial neural networks introduced by Teuvo Kohonen in the 1980s.
Despite of their age, SOMs are still widely used as an easy and robust
unsupervised learning technique
for analysis and visualisation of high-dimensional data.

The SOM algorithm maps high-dimensional vectors into a lower-dimensional grid. Most often
the target grid is two-dimensional, resulting into  intuitively interpretable maps.

For more details see Kohonen's papers, such as

* Teuvo Kohonen, *Biological Cybernetics,* **43** (1982) p. 59-69   

* Teuvo Kohonen, *Biological Cybernetics,* **44** (1982) p. 135-140      

Technical details and background can be found in Kohonen's still relevant
technical report:

## Installation

For installation please refer to the README @github:
<https://github.com/andreasdominik/SOM.jl>


### Matplotlib issues

Common installation problems arise from a known incompatibility between Matplotlib and Julia. The issue seems to be less common for Julia versions v0.7 or later.
However, if the error message contains a line comparable to:

```
...
importError("/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1: version `ZLIB_*.*.*' not found
...
```

then most probably Matplotlib fails to find a required library.   

A first attempt could be to reinstall Matplotlib into the Python
environment of Julia via:

````Julia
ENV["PYTHON"]=""
Pkg.add("Conda")
using Conda
Conda.update()

Conda.add("matplotlib")
Pkg.add("PyCall")
Pkg.build("PyCall")
Pkg.add("PyPlot");
````

A second solution (or second step) is to tell Matplotlib the path to the correct
library, which is provided by Conda.
Temporarily this can be achieved by starting Julia as

````sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.julia/v0.6/Conda/deps/usr/lib; julia
````

with the path replaced by the location of the missing library file.
To specify the path permanently, the following line can be added to the file
```.bashrc``` in the home directory:

````bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.julia/v0.6/Conda/deps/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
````

For training of self-organising maps issues with Matplotlib installation can be ignored; the SOMs will work without Matplotlib. However, Matplotlib visualisations cannot be plotted without Matplotlib.


#### 3-D-Plots

3-D-plotting of spherical SOMs seems to be broken in the latest
versions of PyPlot.
Therefor 3-Dplotting of spheres is not recommended until a new
Plot.jl-based plotting interface is implemneted (is on the to-do-list!).
