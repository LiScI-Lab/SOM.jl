# Quick start: a first tutorial

The concept of SOM.jl follows Kohonen's SOM_PAK software by doing
a 3-step approach:

1) initialise the SOM by defining topology, dimensions and random inital
   codebook vectors
2) train the SOM in one or more rounds with different training parameters
3) map data into the Som and get visualisations.
